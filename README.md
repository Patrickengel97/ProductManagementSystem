SQL Project: Product Item Management System

I am excited to showcase my SQL project focused on building a Product Item Management System. 
This project involves designing and managing a database to store and retrieve product information efficiently.

Implemented Tables:
ProductItem: Stores details of products, including item number, name, type, category, subcategory, size, and price.

Template: Manages templates used for product customization, with attributes like template ID, dimensions, pixel dimensions, optimal resolution, and printing method.

PrintingMethod: Represents various printing methods available for product customization.

Fabric: Stores fabric information such as fabric ID, name, and associated care instructions.

CareInstructions: Provides care instructions for different fabrics.

Features: Captures features that can be associated with products.

Key Features:

Efficiently manage and store product information, including item details, categories, and prices.
Customize product templates with various dimensions, pixel specifications, and optimal resolutions.
Support different printing methods for product customization.
Maintain fabric details, including fabric ID, name, and associated care instructions.
Capture features that can be associated with different products.

Technologies and Skills Utilized:

SQL database design and management
Table creation with primary and foreign key constraints
Data insertion and retrieval operations
Relationship management between tables
Database normalization techniques

Implications and Benefits:

This SQL project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a robust database system for product item management. 
By efficiently organizing and retrieving product information, it facilitates streamlined inventory management, customization options, 
and product feature associations. 
Employing various SQL techniques, I have created a scalable and flexible solution that can be adapted to different business contexts.
